# 🧠 Personal Knowledge Hub

A **self-hosted, offline-first personal knowledge hub** for notes, code snippets, and bookmarks.
Built with **React + React Router + Go backend**, designed to **sync across devices without accounts** using **OTP/QR linking** (similar to Brave browser).

---

## ✨ Features

* 📝 **Notes with MDX support** — Rich Markdown editing powered by [MDXEditor](https://mdxeditor.dev/).
* 🔍 **Full-text search** — Quickly find notes, snippets, and bookmarks.
* 🗂 **Tags & organization** — Organize your knowledge base with tags.
* 📱 **Offline-first (PWA)** — Works without internet using service workers + IndexedDB.
* 🔄 **Device sync without accounts** — Link devices using a short-lived OTP/QR code.
* 💾 **Local-first storage** — Data lives on your device; optional sync to backend.
* ⌨️ **Keyboard shortcuts** — Faster navigation and editing.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend

* ⚛️ [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
* 🖊 [MDXEditor](https://mdxeditor.dev/) for Markdown/MDX notes
* 🎨 [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
* 📦 OPFS for offline-first storage
* 📱 PWA with service workers

### Backend
* [API Repo](https://github.com/zulfikarrosadi/knowledge-hub-api)
* 🐹 [Go](https://go.dev/) + [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com)
* 🗄 Postgres for persistent storage
* 🔑 OTP/QR-based device linking (no traditional auth)
* 🔌 WebSockets for real-time sync

---

## 📐 Architecture

1. **Frontend (React)**

   * Loads offline from PWA cache
   * Stores data in OPFS
   * Syncs with backend when available

2. **Backend (Go)**

   * Provides REST API for CRUD & sync
   * Issues OTP/QR codes for device linking
   * Manages real-time updates with WebSockets

3. **Sync Workflow**

   * Device A generates OTP/QR → shares with Device B
   * Device B enters/scans code → backend links both devices
   * Changes are synced bidirectionally, conflicts resolved with **last-write-wins** (MVP)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ≥ 20
* [Go](https://go.dev/) ≥ 1.22
* Postgres (optional)

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Install deps
pnpm install

# Run in dev mode
pnpm run dev

# Build for production
pnpm run build
```

### Backend Setup
